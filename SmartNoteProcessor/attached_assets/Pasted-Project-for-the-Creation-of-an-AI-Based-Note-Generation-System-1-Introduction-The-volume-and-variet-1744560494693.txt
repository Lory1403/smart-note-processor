Project for the Creation of an AI-Based Note Generation System
1. Introduction
The volume and variety of information that students and professionals need to process are constantly increasing. Traditional note-taking methodologies often struggle to effectively capture, organize, and synthesize information from diverse sources. An AI-based note generation system represents a potential solution to these challenges, offering the possibility to automate and enhance the learning process. This project aims to outline the design of a system capable of analyzing study materials in various formats—texts, images, and videos—to generate a set of well-organized notes in markdown format, interconnected through hyperlinks. The goal is to provide a tool that simplifies studying and professional development, making learning more efficient and targeted.
2. Detailed Breakdown of Project Tasks
A. Task 1: Definition of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
A precise definition of requirements is essential to guide the system's development. Functional requirements specify what the system must do, while non-functional requirements define the system's qualities.
Functional Requirements:
Supported Input Formats: The system must accept various file types. For text documents, formats such as PDF and Word are expected. For images, common formats like JPEG and PNG will be supported. For video content, formats such as MP4 will be included. A crucial aspect will be the ability to extract text from images and PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies. Various Computer Vision platforms, such as Google Cloud Vision API and Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API, offer advanced OCR functionalities. Integrating OCR will ensure that the system can analyze a wide range of study materials, including those containing text in image format.


Content Processing: The system's primary function will be extracting key information and identifying the main topics from input sources. This process will require analyzing textual, visual, and video content to discern fundamental concepts and their relationships.


Information Integration: The system must assess whether the extracted information for a given topic is sufficient and clear. If not, it will integrate supplementary information obtained through web searches. This enrichment mechanism will ensure more comprehensive coverage and greater clarity of the topics covered.


Image Integration: Another important feature will be integrating relevant images into the notes. These images may come from both the original input sources and online resources. Image selection will be based on relevance criteria related to the discussed topic.


Output Format: The final system output will consist of a set of markdown files, a widely used format due to its simplicity and portability.


Hyperlinks: Each markdown file will contain notes related to a specific topic. To facilitate navigation and comprehension, different files will be interconnected through markdown hyperlinks, creating a network of linked information.


Non-Functional Requirements:
Performance: The system must efficiently process study materials. The expected processing time for different input sizes and formats must be considered to ensure a reasonable response time for users.


Scalability: It is crucial to design a system that can handle a growing volume of input data and potentially a large number of users in the future. The architecture should allow resource scaling as needed.


Usability: The generated markdown notes must be easy to read, understand, and navigate. The file structure and use of hyperlinks should contribute to a good user experience, even though direct user interaction is not the primary focus of this project.


Maintainability: The system architecture must be modular and well-documented to facilitate future updates, modifications, and fixes.


Accuracy and Quality: Specific parameters will be defined to evaluate the quality of the generated notes. These may include the completeness of information relative to the original sources, the clarity and correctness of explanations, and the relevance of integrated images.


Security and Privacy: Attention must be paid to handling input data, considering potential privacy implications depending on the nature of the study materials.


Clearly defining these functional and non-functional requirements is a crucial step for the project's success, as it provides guidance for subsequent design and development phases.
B. Task 2: System Architecture Design
The system architecture will consist of several interconnected modules, each with specific responsibilities:
Input Module: Responsible for receiving study materials from the user, recognizing the file format (text, image, video), and extracting initial data (e.g., performing OCR for PDFs and images or preparing video files for analysis).


Content Analysis Module: The core of the system, this module will apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and Computer Vision (CV) techniques for analyzing images and videos. The goal is to extract key information, identify main topics, and understand semantic relationships.


Note Generation Module: This module will structure extracted information into markdown files, organizing content by topic and creating separate files for each.


Information and Image Integration Module: Responsible for evaluating the completeness and clarity of extracted information. If needed, it will conduct web searches for additional details. It will also search for and integrate relevant images based on relevance and visual quality criteria.


Output Module: Responsible for generating the final markdown notes, including hyperlinking between different topic files based on identified relationships.


Data flow between these modules will be sequential, with data passing from one module to another for processing. Implementing a centralized knowledge representation system may be useful for storing extracted information and topic relationships, facilitating data access and management throughout the process.
C. Task 3: Research and Evaluation of NLP and CV Techniques
Analyzing study materials will require employing various NLP and CV techniques, including Named Entity Recognition (NER), Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Keyword Extraction, and Text Summarization. Computer Vision techniques such as Object Detection, OCR, Image Classification, and Video Analysis will also be explored. The selection of tools and APIs (e.g., Google Cloud NLP, Amazon Comprehend, spaCy, Gensim) will be based on accuracy, performance, ease of use, cost, and language support.
D. Task 4: Content Segmentation and Relationship Definition
Developing an algorithm to segment content into distinct topics and define their relationships is essential for well-organized notes. NLP techniques (e.g., topic modeling, text clustering) will be explored for text segmentation, while visual changes in images and videos will be considered for multimedia segmentation. Knowledge graphs and semantic embeddings may be employed to establish hierarchical and semantic relationships between topics.
E. Task 5-8: Quality Evaluation, Image Integration, Markdown Generation, and System Testing
Evaluation Mechanism: Assessing completeness and clarity of extracted information and integrating additional data from web searches.


Image Integration: Selecting and embedding relevant images from input sources and online searches.


Markdown Note Generation: Structuring files with clear headings, subheadings, and hyperlinks for easy navigation.


System Testing and Optimization: Conducting tests with diverse datasets, defining evaluation metrics, gathering user feedback, and iterating improvements based on findings.


3. Considerations for Large-Scale AI Systems
Even though this is a university project, it is beneficial to consider aspects such as data management, computational resource requirements, and scalability. A cloud-based architecture may be a viable option for handling large volumes of data and supporting real-time processing demands.
