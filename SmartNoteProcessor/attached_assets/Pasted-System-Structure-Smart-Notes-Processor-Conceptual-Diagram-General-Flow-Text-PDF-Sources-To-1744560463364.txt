Detailed Modules

1. Topic Extraction Module
Input:
Text sources (PDFs, text documents)
Audio/video sources (after transcription and correction)
Process:
Hierarchical content analysis via NLP:
Level 0 (Selector at 0): Identifies macro-topics (e.g., Quantum Physics)
Level 100 (Selector at 100): Extracts sub-topics hierarchically (e.g., Uncertainty Principle → Heisenberg’s Experiment)
Intermediate Scale (1–99): Adjusts granularity (e.g., at 50: Quantum Physics → Elementary Particles)


Technologies:
NLP models (e.g., BERT, spaCy)
Semantic clustering algorithms (e.g., LDA, TF-IDF)

Output:
Hierarchical topic list in JSON or XML format
Includes timestamps for video/audio sources

2. Audio/Video Transcription & Correction Module
Input:
Multimedia files (e.g., lectures, podcasts)
Process:
Automatic Transcription:
Tools like OpenAI’s Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text
Text Correction:
Removal of repetitions and filler words
Segmentation into thematic paragraphs
Text-audio alignment (for accurate timestamps)
Output:
Clean, structured text ready for topic extraction

3. Image Extraction Module
Input:
Text/PDF documents with embedded images
Video frames (if applicable)
Process:
Automatic detection of figures, graphs, and diagrams
Classification & Naming:
Assigns descriptive titles (e.g., Feynman Diagram: Particle Interaction)
Links images to related topics (e.g., Field Theory)
Technologies:
OCR (Tesseract) for reading text in images
Computer Vision models (e.g., YOLO, ResNet) for classification


Output:
Organized image library with metadata and topic associations

4. Document Synthesis Module
Input:
Hierarchical topic structure from Module 1
Images from Module 3
Process:
Automatic Document Generation:
One document per topic
Inserts relevant content from all sources
Context-aware image placement
Structure Optimization:
Includes sections: Introduction, Examples, Deep Dives
Technologies:
Templates in Markdown or LaTeX
Text generation (e.g., GPT-4 for summarization)
Output:
Editable documents (e.g., .md, .docx)

5. Integration & Enrichment Module
Input:
Base documents
External databases (Wikipedia, academic articles)
Process:
Gap Analysis: Detects missing or weakly covered content
Automatic Additions:
Hyperlinks to external resources
Additional images/graphs
Explanatory notes (e.g., definitions, analogies)



User Interaction:
Manual review panel for accepting, editing, or removing suggestions

Recommended User Interface (UI)
Depth Selector: Slider to adjust topic granularity (e.g., “Level 30: 5 main topics”)
Hierarchical Preview: Visual tree-based topic map
Integrated Editor:
WYSIWYG or markdown editor
Image drag-and-drop
Hyperlink customization

Recommended Technologies
Backend: Python
NLP: NLTK, spaCy
Computer Vision: OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch
Frontend: React.js web app
Database:
MongoDB for structured metadata

Example Workflow
User uploads a biology textbook PDF and a YouTube lecture.
System extracts topics:
With selector at Level 40:
Cell
DNA
Mitosis
Document generation:
Structured notes with images (e.g., "DNA Structure" with a labeled diagram)
Enrichment:
System adds video links, glossary definitions, and explanatory notes
